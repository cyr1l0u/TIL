  * Frank Obusek (geofranker@gmail.com) mentions that NDWI for water, NDVI for vegetation. Maybe Blue/Red for builtup areas. Otsu is best suited for single class extraction and change detection, not mutliclass extraction.

  * Simon (Vsevolod) Ilyushchenko: We have also been running s2cloudless on the full S2 archive. The ingestion is not finished (so there is no catalog entry yet), but you can start using the COPERNICUS/S2_CLOUD_PROBABILITY collection. The assets contain the cloud probability between 0 and 100.
  * Christopher Brown: While the SentinelHub version is at 160m for Slovenia and Croatia 2019, COPERNICUS/S2_CLOUD_PROBABILITY in Earth Engine is at 10m and with global coverage 2019 through 2016 I believe.
